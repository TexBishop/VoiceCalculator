# VoiceCalculator

An Android Studio project.  This is a simple voice-activated calculator with text-to-speech for the resulting answer.  It could theoretically be used by someone unable to see the screen at the time of use; the UI was designed to make such usage easy.

Targets minimum sdk version 23.
